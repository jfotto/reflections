How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Narrowed down the search and made the issue mare apparent

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could always go back to a previous version if the new version is not working

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    There are different stages in your development process when you would want to commit your changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The files may be related and so commiting them together is a good idea

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can see when seperate commits were made and can fine the difference between any 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always back off changes if they are wrong

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
